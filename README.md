# PvE System

A simple PvE cheat for Roblox games.

**Loadstring:**
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LxckStxp/PvE-Modules/main/PVESystem/main.lua"))()
```
What It Does
NPC ESP: Highlights enemies.
Aimbot: Locks onto NPCs with right-click (skips walls, switches if target dies).
Item ESP: Middle-click to toggle tracking on models/parts (small only, ≤10 studs).
UI: Toggle features and set max distance.
How to Use
Inject the loadstring with a Roblox executor.
Controls:
Right-Click: Aimbot on nearest visible NPC.
Middle-Click: Toggle ESP on/off for a model/part.
Use the UI to toggle stuff and adjust distance.
Notes
Aimbot won’t target through walls and auto-switches if the target is gone.
Item ESP tracks exact objects you click, not similar ones.
