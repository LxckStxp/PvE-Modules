# PvE System

A simple PvE cheat for Roblox games.

**Loadstring:**
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LxckStxp/PvE-Modules/main/PVESystem/main.lua"))()
```

## What It Does
- **NPC ESP**: Highlights enemies.
- **Aimbot**: Locks onto NPCs with right-click.
- **Item Tracking**: Middle-click to track small objects.
- **UI**: Toggle features and set max distance.

## How to Use
1. Inject the loadstring with a Roblox executor.
2. **Controls**:
   - Right-Click: Aimbot.
   - Middle-Click: Track items (small only, ≤10 studs).
3. Use the UI to toggle stuff and adjust distance.

## Notes
- Works in most PvE Roblox games.
- No hard-coded items—just click to track.

## Disclaimer
For fun and learning. Follow Roblox rules.
